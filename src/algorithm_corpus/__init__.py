"""Algorithm Competition Corpus.

A pure Python algorithm corpus for Depyler transpilation with EXTREME quality standards.

This package contains 100+ algorithm implementations across 14 categories,
all with full type annotations, peer-reviewed citations, and Popperian
falsification tests.

Categories:
    - graph: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, union-find, etc.
    - dynamic_programming: Knapsack, LCS, LIS, edit distance, etc.
    - sliding_window: Max sum subarray, min window substring, etc.
    - two_pointers: Two sum, three sum, container with water, etc.
    - binary_search: Classic, rotated array, peak element, etc.
    - backtracking: N-queens, permutations, sudoku, etc.
    - bit_manipulation: XOR tricks, counting bits, etc.
    - sorting: Quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, etc.
    - heap_priority_queue: Kth largest, merge K sorted, etc.
    - trees: Traversals, BST validation, LCA, etc.
    - linked_list: Reverse, cycle detection, etc.
    - string: KMP, Rabin-Karp, palindrome, etc.
    - math: GCD, sieve, fast exponentiation, etc.
    - intervals: Merge intervals, meeting rooms, etc.

Quality Standards:
    - Zero external dependencies (stdlib only)
    - 100% type annotation coverage
    - 95% branch test coverage
    - PMAT TDG grade A- or higher
